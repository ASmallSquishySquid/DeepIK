The actual implementations of the algorithms went over my head :(

"Design of neural networks for multi-value regression":
problem: neural networks try to minimize mse
	doesn't know how to handle multiple possible outputs
modular approach
	partition training data according to output range
		proposed algorithm to find ranges
	train neural networks for the subranges
	needs a verification network
feedforward neural networks (which is what we're using)
accuracy decreased with too many modules

"Approximation of inverse system (many-valued function) by neural network":
neural networks are good for one-to-one relationships
change the input and output relationship

"An online algorithm for simultaneously learning forward and inverse kinematics":
specifically about robots
mentions the modular approach
uses the modular approach of previous models with changes
infinite mixture of linear experts
can predict both forward and inverse kinematics with the same model

"Incremental learning of subtasks from unsegmented demonstration":

"A New Artificial Neural Network Approach in Solving Inverse Kinematics of Robotic Arm":
